Each person that is sharing his/her improvement idea should be rewarded (e.g an orange juice, a chocolate, a sandwich) then each time the idea has been implemented by another person the reward should be more valuable. The second part could be a ""Bounty Reward"" given by the management to existing areas in Ericsson that needs improvements .

Such a mechanism in place can also have an option where by the speed limits themselves can be more intelligently updated based on the density of traffic on the roads. #ericssononesiliconvalley","amit.seth@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

It could also be used to rapidly change roads for temporary situations, in factories, and pre-determined routes\n\nRoad transformation is going to be the next big thing in our modern cities design, let's make them smart.\n#ericssononesiliconvalley","omar.zeitoun@ericsson.com","Archived","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/27397/ace93498dc189aa49863b00641b12481.PNG","NULL"

Vehicles in platoon can take turn as front vehicle position.\n3. V2X communication (V2I, V2P, V2N) could be done at the platoon level (P2X) rather than per vehicle. V2V within platoon can then be used for sharing this information to each vehicle.\n4. Members of platoon could leverage V2V communication channel.\n- Gaming between participants of platoon\n- Could talk to each other\n- Negotiate a ride sharing? Park one vehicle and share the ride\n5.

But they have not been applied to the remote maintenance of mobile equipment. Using an augmented reality device, workers could perform troubleshooting on e.g. cabling, and replacement of faulty components. The device would enable the automated selection and display of appropriate documentation (which could be much more visual than the current  text-based documentation), based on installed base, and also enable sharing of the operator view with a centralized subject matter expert (which could be provided by Ericsson). This would decrease the cost of operation for the mobile operator, and increase the precision in interactions between the mobile worker and the remote system. The creation of appropriate documentation would also be an interesting project which could be added to the offer to the customer.\n#ericssononebeijing","johan.hjelm@ericsson.com","Moved to IdeaBoxes","0","NULL","NULL"

Although, the deployment of these SCBs is good for capacity enhancement and pervasive coverage, it suffers from interference and user mobility issues due to combined control and data plane. To overcome these issues, a new Radio Access Network (RAN) has  recently been proposed in 5G that splits the control and the data plane. \n5G networks  have  the  ability  to  cater  the  needs  of  higher number of users. Significant increase in number of users will consume more energy and hence leads to more carbon emission. The main idea behind this approach is to propose self sustainable 5G networks by using clean energy.

"20846","Home Sustainability Gateway","2019-07-01 03:12:46","Old electronics are often thrown away even though they work, because they do not implement new features. Often, new features can be mapped to old features or combinations of old features, however. The idea is to implement a gateway (home gatweway) which can perform the mapping and possibly perform additional functions required to complete the mapping, so that the life of old electronics can be extended (an example is that old TVs could be provisioned with Internet connectivity to provide e.g. Netflix services).. This improves sustainability and decreases waste in the environment, not to speak of saving money for users. Ericsson is uniquely positioned to provide such a gateway, as we can put it in the cloud for our customers to implement, and provide a way for the device manufacturers to connect to it.\nUpdate: I enclose two files describing the product we developed, which as you can see already was well on its way to do what I describe. \n\n#ericssononebeijing","johan.hjelm@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/28786/4e2863d6dc3cb23edfd4bf0bebbb7fbd.pdf,uploads/ideas/attachments/28786/c3cb91d4685aad3150e3eeb5bc811dc7.pdf","NULL"

This deters roaming subscribers from using their home contracts while abroad. Data roaming is also very expensive compared to local plans and this deters visitors from using it thus limiting the revenue of the visited GSM provider. \n\nSolution\nIf the mobile phone has eWallet with some credit line (say via linked credit cards), the visited network does not need to contact home network for billing purposes, may be only for retrieving customer ID information. Instead, necessary fee can be automatically blocked on the e-wallet/associated credit card and charged later according to local tariffs.

A lot of the inputs depend on customer input, some are to be extracted from the live nodes to generate a traffic profile. With the same inputs given to different people with the same tools the results are almost always different. Customers do not trust our results because they have seen real network performance that is contrary to what we have shown from our tools. We keep blaming rapidly changing customer behavior (less voice, more data centric, OTT etc) but we need to be ahead of the curve.\nIdea:\nCreate a Machine Learning algorithm that can be trained from terabytes of data we have available from real world networks we have access to that are at different maturity levels and use this to model network performance for different nodes in diverse networks with greater certainty.\n/EONE will give this idea more visibility\n#ericssononesweden","charlie.sekakoni@ericsson.com","Moved to IdeaBoxes","0","NULL","NULL"

Both ""good parts"" and the duration of the battery are personal (charge level may be the same but no two individuals have the same behaviour), so the context needs to be personalized. \nFor the TV producer, this is not hard to implement (you only need to prioritize and tag the segments of the show, if there is support in the servers), and can result in an upsell opportunity since advertising can be included which the user otherwise would not have watched.\n#ericssononebeijing","johan.hjelm@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","NULL","NULL"

Supporting switching calls requires complex infrastructure while the bandwidth occupied by the voice call is hardly 64 kbps. This looks antique compared to bandwidth, which 5G offers. However, switched voice calls still remain the main cash cow of MSP, which they are trying to protect by impeding VoIP proliferation.\nSolution\nInstead of charging for legacy voice calls and keeping high roaming tariffs MSP should change the paradigm of billable Internet access in principle. Today they can segregate traffic by Voice, Video or Data by using DPI. Why not to make the MSP bill proportionate only to the amount of traffic consumed by Video or Voice? This would immediately have positive impact on MSP/OTT economics because MSP will be interested building more capacity thus generating more revenue. Switched voice billing per minute will become legacy in this approach.\n#ericssononesweden","alexandr.bratchik@ericsson.com","Moved to IdeaBoxes","0","NULL","NULL"

When thousands of HD streams compete for limited bandwidth this will lead to enormous demands on the infrastructure. Games streaming multimedia through the network would also eat up bandwidth. But there are ways to alleviate this. Moving content to the edge and enabling edge processing are two. But we are not exploring ways of condensing the core network traffic, e.g. by sending command primitives to edge caches enabling playout from the location closest to the user. This could be sold as nodes attaching to the content providers and leveraging a combination of CDN, edge computing (or rather edge reasoning) and low-bandwidth protocols enhancing or improving the customer experience (for instance, enabling AR gaming).

When repair is available, HWS demand calculated only covers scrap quantities during repair, thus less new buy of spare parts. Supply uses the HWS demand calculated, together with other inputs, to take over the product from BNEP.\nHowever, it is possible that when BNEP hands over the product to Supply, there are excess stock at BNEP that are enough to cover the full HWS demand without repair for some periods or till EOL. In this case, we can apply inventory-driven supply codes at SP LTB for HWS, stop repair and utilize the existing excess inventory within Ericsson.

The idea is that your car automatically connects with the city-hall parking controller center to indicate when you arrived and left the parking and afterward it calculates and sends the recipe automatically to your bank account.

"23556","Ubiquitous OTT Voice for developing country expats","2019-10-30 10:13:10","Problem:\nExpats from developing countries residing in developed countries generate large volumes of intl. voice traffic back home. A large part of this traffic goes through OTT such as Skype, etc. Due to the low penetration of MBB and smartphones in developing countries, the OTT service remains mostly constrained to fixed broadband. \n\nIdea\nOffer a basic OTT voice service with local number paid for and used by the expat residing abroad. The service accessible by the expat using a smartphone app enables calls to/from any relatives in the home country on 2G/3G phones. The addressable market can be reasonably assumed to be in the tens of millions of potential subscribers. In this model, the expat becomes a new type of subscriber high relative ARPU for the developing country operator. The resulting relationship between the expat and the developing country operator could be further leveraged to offer money remittance services – a far larger multi-billion dollar business.\n#ericssononesweden","olivier.bonenfant@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/29300/06404a9a1d0ad0c76e1d6e85f3a6c491.png","NULL"

For the terrible accidents which need ambulance, the traffic jam usually slows down the arriving time of the ambulance. Therefore, we need an efficient way to help the policeman to issue the ticket as soon as possible, connect to the hospital/doctor if there are injured people etc.\n\nWith the drone & 5G networks, when there is accident, policeman can send the drone to the accident scene. The drivers can talk to the policemen, show the ID, insurance via drone. Policeman can control the drone to take photos. In this way, the accidents can be handled quickly. If there are people injured, the nearest hospital/doctor can use the communication channel on the drone to guide the emergency treatment.

Remind that data itself don't have info for the localization in the memory, SW system track where are your data. Any movement is registered into the system.

The challenge for developers is that there's no standardized APIs access, it means every car manufacture defines different CAN messages and IDs for vehicle functionalities, this will push developers to make several applications with the same functionalities for several vehicle models. \nTo tackle this challenge, we propose this idea to create an orchestration/Broker layer between the developers and the open APIs.

To be successful, IoT products must have compute, storage & networking baked-in when they're manufactured. Products are created in one country, shipped to a distributor in another & purchased by a customer in a third . Our connection mgmt platform allows a product to wake up anywhere in the world & make a connection to a local CSP. We can further reduce the friction in bootstrapping a new device by providing an ""IoT DNS"" service. The device accesses a globally-available service to pass along its identity &temporary security credentials. What & where the product is, who bought it & what IoT platform it should send its telemetry to is determined. The device is registered with the IoT platform & downloads security tokens or certificate. The data schema/digital twin of the device is sent to the IoT platform so it & its associated analytics will know how to interpret the incoming telemetry to create value.\n#ericssononesiliconvalley","rob.tiffany@ericsson.com","Learnings","0","NULL","NULL"

An urban city is characterized of multi-dwelling (MDU) high-rise buildings, mixed-use commercial buildings, narrow streets, and high density of bandwidth hungry subscribers.  MNOs, though lucrative, serving these urban customers would require network densification with Advanced Antenna systems to handle line of sight, capacity and coverage requirements. For subscribers, install an outdoor or window mounted antenna’s and a PoE cable to their home CPE.

We are going to screening for quality at least 10% of production on burning tests. To guarantee quality and avoid high return rates from field, these burning tests consume time and a energy (2KW/h x 24/48h) per batches of 6 radios. Another challenge related what to do with radiation. If we consider the forecast portfolio (GPP) for radio (4G, 5G), we are talking about a lot of radiation and energy. Current solutions to avoid radiation include typically shield chambers and attenuators and loads with cooling system to disipate energy, avoid harmful radiation in factories and invasion of commercial radio spectrum. Some approach was done to radiate towards ceiling or underground floor in factories. But it requires costly inversions for big chambers and still wasting a lot of energy.

If so, then it should be possible to detect anomalies in the radio networks and use these as indicators of potential fires. If such an anomaly is detected, an automated system including (eg) 5G controlled drones could spring into action. The drones are guided to the spot the anomaly was detected and using IR-cameras and sensors they will send data to a datacentre where an automated system will determine whether or not a real fire is underway. If that is the case, then the fire department is notified. This model could easily be scaled up adding various input sources as well as adding additional contact points for action (including persons living close to the fire).\n#ericssononesweden","johan.r.olsson@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

There are apps for dating, finding sports partner, language exchange, ride sharing and more. These apps allow for planning of such interactions rather than enabling them here and now.\n\nSolution:\nEvery smartphone has a Bluetooth module that can transmit periodically (once every 5 sec) a short beacon and scan for other beacons. Beacons carry a unique ID, a web service can be queried for this ID from a received beacon to get the information about someone’s intentions. If some of the intentions match user’s own intentions, a notification is generated. Since Bluetooth is a short-range technology,  such matches can happen only when two smartphones are in a vicinity of up to 10-50 meters. No need to establish a Bluetooth connection either, beacons are broadcasted.\n\nMonetisation:\nLocation-based ads, individual preferences-based ads, freemium model.\n#ericssononesweden","roman.chirikov@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","NULL","NULL"

I was thinking, if someone is in need of food, water or medicines (esp., daily wage workers) we could figure out a way to create a network (using our technology) on how these resources can reach the needy - in developing countries its still a challenge. If some of us put our minds to this, I think we can contribute in some way…\n\nFor e.g., We recently saw incidences of tons of milk and meat discarded in USA due to lack of supply chain or over virus scare - while there is need for supply of these basic commodities elsewhere. If there is a network to know where the demand is and if supplies can be routed accordingly, it would help people from starving and get food and supplies on time & save food too.\n#ericssononesiliconvalley","ramanath.s.shanbhag@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

Thrift is a virtue, yet it seemingly stays in the way of modern economy and has been left in the past. With increasing human population and material demands, the finite natural resource on earth will face its limit in long and short term. We need to find a way to fuse both interest, long and short-term benefit. We can tackle the challenge from both end. First, when we cannot avoid waste, in the common cycle of production and consumption, we can put thought and effort to make recycle waste attractive to end consumer. An automated recycling process for instance, that is less time consuming, and economically profitable.\nSecond (yet not last), we can commercialize ""thrift"" itself, make it ""purchasable"". A badge that citizens can acquire, nourish, preserve and display. Make thrift the new fashion, that is popular to young and old.\n#ericssononebeijing","yixian.song@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","NULL","NULL"

The lack of automation in disassembly is due to the complexity of the products and lack of transparency. The materials that make a product arriving at recycling plants are not well understood.\nThis results in ineffective disassembly both during mechanical processing and chemical processing\n\nSolution:\nA standardized approach for sharing automated disassembly instructions to recycling industry. The instruction set for assembly and disassembly are just the opposite of each other. A standard that covers the assembly also covers the disassembly.\nExample: The sequence of instructions to an assembly robot can be used in disassembly.  A common structure covers both robotic assembly and disassembly.\n\nIdea owners: Mladen Toncev, Maria Ahlvik, Jani Rutanen, Louise Hulten, Jagadeesh Arunachalam\n#ericssononesweden","jagadeesh.arunachalam@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","NULL","NULL"

For instance, high heart rate can reflect certain state of the user such as stress level and high activity which is crucial for how the human brain perceives its environment, for instance, a video stream application. The difference in the delay perceptions can be potentially mapped to the human state and can be learned by an AI agent to be exploited by the cellular network to minimize power consumption and utilize the available radio resources more efficiently.\n#ericssononesweden","ursula.challita@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

Working from home also reduces unplanned random meetings with people and connecting with new people is more difficult.\n\nIdea:\nThe idea is to have a webapp that connects the user to a randomly selected teams meeting for max 10 people. This simulates the queue at the office coffee machine and connects you to new people you can have interesting discussions and create new bonds with. This will also help to release some stress when working at home and not been able to meet people.\n\nWhy?\nEricsson is a great place to test this idea because a) We are all working from home currently and have a perfect community to test and prototype the idea and b) we need new connections to happen inside the company in order to be more innovative and effective in our daily work.\n\nProduct:\nThis could be a simple web app on the Ericsson home page or it could become a Teams add-on application.","jani.rutanen@ericsson.com","Moved to IdeaBoxes","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/42713/08a3fa30bb2a92b3b9063f4e50009c18.png","NULL"

As demonstrated in the linked paper, a jet engine can be created which works with electricity as fuel. If this was used in emergency power plants, this would mean we could create power plants which do not need fuel, only batteries. And if we provide the batteries with a mobile sensor to send their charging status, we can always control the emergency power (and nobody will steal the fuel, which sometimes happens). To build such a power plant would probably be best if done in cooperation with some other companies, which have competence in the emergency power plant area, such as Hitachi or Toshiba. We would have to establish some Ericsson advantage so we are not just reselling someone elses product however. Hence, this project would have three parts: 1. Establish Ericsson advantage. 2.

And the distribution details are unknown; this is important because the production might be clean but the transportation might not.\nIdea: To solve this, we need to verify how a product is produced and distributed.

I have a patent (US 8,649,765 Bl) which enables the use of the human heartbeat as an identifier for the eSIM. However, that is not the current idea. Instead, building on those two, you can use the human heartbeat to encrypt a medical database with the heartbeat of the user (as a seed). This will make fraud impossible, and it enables you to allow access to the database only when the user is actively holding his device (this is a separate IvD, P81465). There are two businesses here: 1. to device manufacturers and operators, enabling verification of the actual person using the device. 2. to the medical database owners, who would be able to verify that the user is the right person at all times (of measurement).

But lot of us are required to push buttons in Number pads in our daily lives, lift buttons, PIN pads, etc. They are potential sources of spreading the virus too. People are fearful of the touching anything touched several people. Even if the virus gets under control in near future the fear may stay with us for quite some time.\n\nIdea: Use a smartphone app and a Bluetooth device to input number instead of touching the number pads. For example, in front of lift we enter the floor number in the app instead pushing the button in a lift. Lift accepts the number as if the button was pushed.\n\nWhy: Ericsson developed the Bluetooth Technology. This would require both hardware and software development, hardware and software for the addition of the Bluetooth in the number pads and app for the smartphones.

Many companies including Ericsson is trying to get this done through drones. The problem is that flying drones commercially still needs licenses and for most places not allowed, also needs a pilot, device itself is expensive and is not All-weather suitable.\nSolution: A small magnetic device having a High res pan and tilt camera, that can climb a tower just like an off-road 4x4, this device will not be needing any certifications and licenses, very easy to operate like small RC car from the ground. being magnetic is just a way to get it attached to the structure, there are many other ways the device can stick and climb.","wajahat.jamil@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

Based on  hours of training per day the player undergoes he/she can achieve a professional status by age of 22/ 18. Football coaches in the current scenario use multiple drills in order to improve the passing, shooting, receiving and trapping skills of a player. The players have to ensure continuous practice to get a grip and master the mentioned skills.\n\nIntroducing technology into coaching will help the coaches reduce the overall training hours of a player to acquire professional status.The solution proposes an IoT/Cat-M device which will be installed on the footwear of the player to measure a number of KPIs related to contact of foot with the ball.\n\nEricsson predicts there will be 5 billion IoT devices by 2025 connected via cellular 3GPP access technologies.

For specialized services such as ""drone as a printer"", there is room for further radio/network optimizations.\n   \n- Cellular technology can also be used to ensure secure printing: Human contact can be eliminated with drone-based printing.

If you can determine where a user is and what time he is there, and that it is this particular unique user, then new applications which leverage the user being in a specific position become possible. E.g. an policeman can file irrefutable evidence for being in a certain position at a certain time, which can not be falsified. This can be extended to other similar applications, such as the cameras carried by police officers in the US (it would be possible to determine exactly which officer did what on a scene), if a continuous recording is combined with the above; and the recording is sent to a central location for continuous analysis. So the idea is to leverage the users identity, precise position, and information captured from on-person cameras to determine what exactly is happening at a scene.

In addition the students would NOT need buy an expensive AR glass.\nWe are part of specialized group within Ericsson currently working with AR/MR applications, 3D contents and AR/MR platforms. Further, 5G is essential to secure quality of experience due to high bandwidth for a large-scale processing of complex 3D holographic content and low latency to allow perfect interaction between AR user,  3D content and the real-world environment.","karam.takieddine@ericsson.com","Learnings","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/35125/2310977f46e5fa3f3ea96598c82164e7.pptx","NULL"

The solution is a win-win for the retailer and the customer. For the retailer, a dynamic pricing scheme allows waste reduction (which in turn reduces her operational costs) while optimizing her return. On the other hand, the price-conscious customer now has the option of buying the same product at a reduced price provided he can consume it within a shorter timespan. This is particularly relevant in the current pandemic where a flexible pricing scheme is a key ingredient to addressing food waste.\nA more comprehensive barcode also yields richer purchasing information which in turn leads to deeper market analytics and, possibly, more optimal pricing functions.

As the data is constantly growing, challenges in static analytics increase. As a resolution, we propose Ericsson Data Lab (EDL) that provides meaningful insights from the network data by utilizing modern data science measures including machine learning, dimensional reduction and statistics. These insights include, e.g., customer & device profiling, detection of network threats and anomalies, network performance analysis, detection of suspicious/zombie devices, peak traffic hours, etc.\n\nEDL would provide analytics as a service for internal business and development organizations. By utilizing these services, the teams do not need to hire data scientists to find insights from data, rather than they can focus on accelerating their core competence. EDL would follow the quest for easy in service philosophy: bring in the data - receive the insights. EDL brings competitive edge by introducing business-critical insights before the customer realizes them. Moreover, strategic insights from EDL can be used to kickstart AI-projects within the organizations.","anonymous@ideadrop.co","Moved to IdeaBoxes","0","NULL","NULL"

Then we (customer and Ericsson) announce an innovation program (sponsored by customer, university, or government) to develop mobile services (targeting 5G use cases), inviting students, researchers, and local businesses.\n\n This will give a clear benefit for Ericsson and its customers on several levels. #Ericsson2030","hans.sandholt@ericsson.com","Archived","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/46530/6c2c4960ad0e6095fe5833c3dda188c3.docx","NULL"
"30216","Automatic stitching robot - svnd","2020-12-03 14:05:14","My target is for apparel industry. Use case is to stitch the clothes in bulk order. This industry needs to depend on huge manpower (approx. 50 people required an average). They need many tailors to Stitch the clothes in bulk order. Because of the huge manpower the OPEX cost is very high (Approx cost is Rs 6000 per person about Rs 300000 required per month). Profit margin is only 2 to 3 % which is very less, so many industries are getting closed as they are unable to manage this cost. So, my idea is to  reduce the OPEX cost by replacing the human tailors with an automatic stitching robots. I will design a robot in an optimal cost so that common man can use it and earn the profits in the industry. Please give me opportunity to explain in detail about my idea if you need more explanation about the problem statement.","k.ravi.teja@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

If wearing an existing mask, the inside of the mask will be damp, creating an unsightly wet scar on the mask, which is somewhat indecent. And masks need to be replaced immediately.\nMy idea is to design an absorbent mask that can function as a medical mask at the same time.\nOn the face-facing side of the original medical mask, a layer of water-absorbing resin, also called superabsorbent polymers (SAP) , is added on the upper lip position. The size of the absorbent resin is close to the size of the adult upper lip. It is specially used to absorb secretions such as nasal discharge. People can quietly help blow their nose with their hands outside the mask, without having to remove the mask, to avoid some embarrassment. It is also suitable for people with cold.  it can reduce the frequency of cold patients to remove the mask to clean the nose, and reduce the chance of infection to others.  Another advantage of this mask is that it can keep the inside of the mask dry and lasts for at least 4 hours.","jane.shu@ericsson.com","Submitted","0","NULL","NULL"

Analyzing network traces is difficult because of the dynamic header indexing in the HPACK algorithm. When a network capture does not capture the first time that a header was sent, the header field cannot be ascertained, and Data cannot be dissected. Wireshark can only display ""Header: unknown"" because only the index of the header has seen. And because HTTP/2 sessions can last days or even months, it is very common that when a network trace is started there will already be many cached headers.\n\nThis results in much wasted time/effort in preparation/retesting in order to capture the necessary details for troubleshooting or as evidence for test cases. This pain has been felt across many projects involving most or all of the Ericsson 5G portfolio. A solution would save countless manhours, shorten integration time, and elevate customer's perception of Ericsson.\nThe HTTP/2 standard allows the size of the dynamic table to be set to 0. This prevents the caching of headers and forces the full header content to be sent each time. We need an ""Integration mode"" that sets the size of the dynamic table to 0 so that we can capture each header when needed.","anonymous@ideadrop.co","Moved to IdeaBoxes","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/46623/9ab6bb1fc9b36c8d6317c6849e2e6148.docx","NULL"

This expansion has led to the energy consumption in radio networks becoming a significant contributor to the electricity usage and operational expenditures of operators.\nBy forecasting/predicting the traffic on each site, cluster or a larger geographical area over the next X number of hours we can operate those sites in ""Energy Saving"" mode by enabling some of the energy efficiency features such as ""MIMO Sleep"" or even locking down some of the Mid/High-Band nodes/carriers which are mainly intended for increased throughput/capacity.\nWhile this will help restoring the energy and reducing the carbon emission, the operators can also leverage this opportunity to sell the restored power to energy companies to meet their peak power demands.\nWe expect more opportunities in 5G with exponential growth in data traffic and much denser deployments in the network.\nWe did a proof of concept by running this idea using the P3 crowdsourced dataset.

To meet those objectives, a series of related tasks are combined into something we call a ""role"" or a ""job."" A collection of roles working toward the same objective is typically grouped together into a ""department."" Organizations typically hire people to fill those roles and those people interact with each other. It's important to note that the success of the organization is dependent on those roles accomplishing their tasks whether a person has been hired to fill that role or not.\n\nA more forward-looking view of organizational structure would be to define a particular role as a Digital Twin model that includes all the attributes of that role and tasks to be accomplished. A Digital Twin instance represents that actual ""filled"" role that may or may not be a person. These Digital Twins are brought to life by software Bots that ""behave"" based on the defined attributes and digitally carry out defined tasks.

On the other hand there are many returns also happening for online ordering due to mis-fit which incur loss to the stores and dissatisfaction to the end customers as a whole.\n\nThe idea is to build a web platform connecting all the local tailors based on their zip codes. Now when a customer orders some garment from the catalog they need to upload a full size image. On the back end by using a proper scaling factor the platform will estimate actual measurement of the dress which will fit the customer. Then the platform will send the order with details to the nearest tailor who is having all the stock of required materials for that order. Then based on the work load the tailor will give some estimate of delivery to the customer and once ready he/she can directly mail the package to the customer.\n\nBenefit: This way tailors will get business and also customers will get customized orders. This will eventually reduce the profit sharing which will enable the tailors to make good money.

Or the factory and robots re adapted to start building new vehicles segments and customized (e.g. color inside or outside)?\n\n - Could this partnership improve Ericsson value (e.g. brand name, stock price) by using the technology to change the world with more efficient solutions?\n - Probably Ericsson could use some of the technology used by Tesla on our base stations (e.g. batteries). Imagine one of our base stations with ""Powered by Tesla""","pedro.cruz@ericsson.com","Moved to improvement","0","NULL","NULL"
"31138","Port and ship API broker","2021-02-25 04:06:34","Problem: As we could read in the Ericsson Connected Ports report, it takes 36 hours on average to replenish a ship. While it is loaded and unloaded, there are a number of other operations going on, which could be automated. These include emptying wastewater tanks, refilling the galley, providing various supplies like paint and tools for the crew, changing the crew, etc. In particular the fueling can be a major moneysaver - most ships just fill up the tanks, but you do not need to fill more than it would take to go to the next port of call. Why: All of these (except the crew) can be automated using sensors, which could send a purchase list to the port when the ship arrives, and the supplies would be waiting at the dock. Idea: However, while the moneysaving might motivate both parties (Ship and port), the business opportunity lies in creating an API-driven marketplace with automated procurement, so that the ship sends its shopping list (e.g. via EDIFACT), and an automated marketplace distributes the orders to the suppliers, enabling them to bid. The marketplace would award the contract to the chosen bidder and arrange delivery. An AI could potentially be integrated to e.g. determine when goods can be substituted. ","johan.hjelm@ericsson.com","Contacted","0","NULL","NULL"

The idea\n      For each new version of dallas, do continuous integration testing and deployment. Use jekins as the basic platform for continuous integration. Whenever a new version of dallas is delivered, it runs pre-defined test cases together with the current most stable product version (the product can be amf, smf and other SUTs that use dallas as a simulation tool) , These test cases can be either functional test level or system test level. The result of the integration test is directly displayed on the interface, and more detailed log and related configuration information are stored. If the integration test is passed, the new version will be released directly. Of course, if the integration test fails, there will be two situations. One is the bug of the new version of dallas itself, and the other may be the bug of SUT, so further modules can be added to analyze the integration test results, integrate big data and artificial intelligence technology, automatically analyze the cause of the problem, and automatically Report to a dedicated person for further analysis.","shuming.jiang@ericsson.com","Contacted","0","NULL","NULL"

Today, most people have a helmet because, among other things, it is more comfortable in cold weather and warms their ears better than a hat. The head injuries in alpine skiing have thus been drastically reduced and a cultural change has also been created by using protective equipment. There is no rule that says you must wear a helmet. A cultural change has taken place and it is strange not to wear a helmet. We need to make this journey in the construction industry as well.\n\nWearing a safety helmet in very hot weather can feel very uncomfortable. On the other hand, it would be nicer to wear the helmet than to be without a helmet if it cooled your head. Usage would increase and fewer accidents would occur.\n\nMany companies today struggle to get their employees to wear helmets even though it is a rule.\n\nThere is a small space in all protective helmets between the inner measurement and the outer shell itself. There you could place one or more mini fans that are connected in a small wire that is led to the outside of the helmet with a small weightless solar cell plate.

The seniors may feel unheard, and the we are missing part of the cultural heritage.\n\nPROPOSAL: Create books/cartoons out of stories told by our seniors on phone calls\n      1. When calling them and wanting to create a story, press a button and start recording (respecting the privacy at other personal calls)\n      2. AI processes the information and creates a summarized story according to settings: Realistic - kid bed time story...\n      3. Choose characters that will be shown in the cartoon/book\n      4. Download the story\n\nBENEFITS:\n      - Seniors feeling heard and beloved\n      - Seniors can participate in the election of settings, as selecting which cartoon character they want to be represented in: interaction with tech\n      - Everlasting historic family cultural inheritage \n      - Higher family attatchment\n      - In the event of memory lost for the eldearly, easy to access past stories as a therapy","leire.carreras@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

They have to wait for someone to do everything for them, and unfortunately, do not get to see or interact with their family nearly as much as they would like to. My solution: Everything voice activated. Their vision starts to get worse, their hands start to shake, and their memory starts to fade, so everything needs to be big, displayed on a tablet or their TV. No small screens that displays their text too small, or has buttons they either can't push or don't remember how to. Have verbal commands to call or answer calls, have access to personal phone books, provide verbal calendar commands for reminders about appointments - and the ability to set them, and provide simple verbal TV commands that don't require the reliance on a remote. This system would need good audio with the ability to understand people who speak slower or may have accents as well; and vise versa. This system could also provide the option for a virtual photo album that has pictures and videos added to it a soon as they are shared, so even when people don't have time to come in person to visit they can still be in touch with them & ""see"" them.","brenda.sachs@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

Advertisement customer just need select the area and number, upload the advertise file and paid the money online.

It would bring along the next industrial revolution. But easier said than done.\n\nManufacturing is a cost induced industry. Every change must be cost effective. There are many MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) in manufacturing which can’t afford to move to 5G driven automated manufacturing facilities. An Ericsson powered, in collaboration with different government and local manufacturing groups, Integrated Manufacturing Hub (IMH) is proposed to bring this transformation. IMH can be a state of the art manufacturing facility, leveraging latest technologies including 5G, which can be available as a service to all nearby manufacturing enterprises. They can book and manufacture the smaller and regular parts at the IMU while their own manufacturing facility deals with the niche parts and assembling units.\n\nEricsson, being the technological leader in communication industry, can become the force multiplier for such manufacturing facilities, eventually leading the industry to the transformation we seek – a fully automated and integrated manufacturing facility at each of these enterprises. ","mukul.priyadarshi@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","NULL"

Rather than focus on those details and use cases, I think it's important to work backwards from the creation of a multi-billion dollar business. Seniors are living longer, more active lives and have the most disposable income of any generational group. In the U.S. alone, there are 52 million adults over the age of 65. I want to wrap seniors in a comprehensive security blanket of services and charge them $49.95 a month. Subscriptions from just a million of those folks in America would earn Ericsson around $600 million per year. Using our digital twin expertise, we'll create a Digital Avatar for each senior citizen that defines who they are, their preferences, their health status, who they interact with, the things they need to remember, what makes them happy, and who to contact in an emergency. This Avatar is their constant companion and is what Ericsson will interface with to provide the intelligent, connected services that allow seniors to live a better life.

Instead of paying for green energy supply, operators would effectively have the optionality of deploying a distributed, green alternative.

Passenger cars provide 43% of all CO2 emissions generated by all transportation in Europe.\nCar's emissions greatly depend on the style of driving, especially in the cities. Examples of bad driving habits: rapid acceleration, poor speed planning, very short trips.\nAlthough good habits are taught in driving schools, they can only be enforced by applying fines. Today there is no country-wide system available to implement such fines.\n\nSolution:\nMonitor driver's behaviour by either accessing connected car's sensors' readings (e.g., instant fuel consumption) or by real-time localisation of a connected car using cellular network.\nIf a bad driving style is detected by processing the data, a fine to the car's owner is issued automatically.\n\nCustomer:\nMunicipalities.\n\nBenefits:\nSafer streets and less emissions in the cities.\n\nWhy Ericsson:\nThis is a business case for our IoT platform that we can solve together with operators.","anonymous@ideadrop.co","Moved to improvement","0","NULL","NULL"

"32362","Smart headphone","2021-05-27 03:15:48","Problem\nActive Noise Cancellation Headphones becomes popular. It also provides “Transparency mode”. “Active Noise Cancellation mode” blocks out the world, so you can focus on what you’re listening to. “Transparency mode” allows things to sound. The choice for user is “either…or” at same time. But in many cases, for example, when I am standing in the subway car, enjoying the immersive music, but the subway broadcasted information is also very important to me. I don’t want to miss any important notification, warning, etc. I want a headphone with the mode that block all noise, except for pre-identified meaningful sound.  \nSolution  \nSound is a pressure wave, which consists of alternating periods of compression and rarefaction. Active Noise Control uses adaptive algorithms to analyze the waveform of the background aural or nonaural noise. We can train adaptive algorithms to identify pre-defined sound. The smart ANC headphone can create destructive interference by using inverted signal to actively block noise, but amplify the pre-defined voice signal in order to let user receive the sound. \nThe pattern could be:  \n1. Pre-recorded subway broadcast voice (in public)  \n2. Your wife’s voice (at home)  \n3. Your boss’s voice (in office)  \n4. Others.","kan.lou@ericsson.com","Contacted","0","NULL","NULL"

Checks and screening (e.g., change in shape of limbs affected by diabetes) are manual and previous history may be lost. There is little incentive for providers to coordinate data interoperability. Improvement starts with patients truly owning their medical records and history.\n\n\nIdea\n\n\nA 5G sensor network scans patients and collects vitals, body 3D. Data is added to the patient’s “healthcare digital ID” stored in a app and compared with patient’s data previously collected (data remains with patient and provider).

This would result dramatically decreasing voice data size for lower data transfer requirements and then reconstruct it back once it arrives to it's destination.\n\n\nEven in cases where the target is not to decrease voice data size, it could potentially also be used for repairing damaged voice data due to packet loss or maybe reduce jitter artificially.\n\n\nIn order to do this, we would need to train AI and ML like NVIDIA and include this feature in our basebands (include NPUs to process this or maybe use GPU for not only L1 acceleration processing but also to handle this feature with Cloud RAN).","joshua.kirim.kim@ericsson.com","Contacted","0","uploads/ideas/attachments/38666/174b234c822790db8fb100b833518644.jpg","NULL"

If the vehicle is in the preset contact list, it will be prompted by voice and then you can choose whether to communicate by voice or not. The advantage of this is that drivers who are in the same zone and know each other can communicate by voice conveniently and quickly without the help of personal radio or social IM Apps that needs connection to the Internet.","allan.wang@ericsson.com","Submitted","0","NULL","NULL"

"33140","A more secure way to handle recycled numbers","2021-07-13 19:34:09","MSISDNs, aka phone numbers, are a limited resource. So, it is a standard practice for Communications Service Provider (CSPs) to recycled them. It varies according to country regulations and internal CSP policies, but a common reason for that is when a pre-paid subscriber exceeds a pre-determined time interval without refilling. Thus, phone number recycling poses at least three problems:\n(a) Several security and privacy issues in the context of multi-factor authentication. \n(b) Outdated contact info of delinquent customers. There are several cases where collection agencies get sued for insistently contacting the new owner of the phone, instead of the old one. \n(c) Outdate contact info on mobile apps for end-users. This is not a major issue, but it can be a business case: Google could pay for this info so they could add a special label “recycled/stale” on contact apps.\nThe underlying challenge is to determine whether a MSISDN has been recycled.","celso.freitas@ericsson.com","Contacted","0","NULL","NULL"

If the compressor is driven directly by rotation of the wind turbine's shaft, losses associated with mechanical-to-electrical conversion could be avoided.

The connected car can then initiate an advanced toll transaction like blocking the toll fee for each toll collection point in advance and then as it approaches the toll it executes the transaction and on successful transaction, notifies the toll collection system so that the car need not stop or slow down at the collection point.

If a stolen vehicle is detected lurking the truck, a warning alert is generated. If the criminal approach materializes, the robber turns on its jammer that can be detected by an ML-based anti-jammer. A confirmation alert is generated and the lightweight fallback geo-localizer based on NB-IoT (robust against jamming) is activated.

A few CEOs of large retail chains admitted that their store managers did not optimize prices for all products due to “managerial friction.” Prices are set at the corporate level. In other words, store managers are busy and don’t have time and data to adjust prices.\n\n\nNow imagine that you are the CEO of 7-Eleven and Ericsson knocks on your door with an easy solution: IoT price tags.

Good to see that drones are now tested for delivering the products across few places. Remote sensing drones and security drones are also used in many places. There is a hidden market place where we could use the traffic monitoring system using 5G. As a technology leaders we could use the technology to monitor the traffic system and also we could use the drones to monitor the anomaly on the flight path (great SOS sensing system can be introduced within).\n Business Perspective:\n A new business can be opened up for the retailers market. SOS can be introduced for betterment. Holographic upgradation of the live traffic may attract all the customers in market.","govindhan@ericsson.com","Archived","0","NULL","kasi.narayanaswamy@ericsson.com"
